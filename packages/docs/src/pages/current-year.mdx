# CurrentYear

import ExportMetaInfo from '../components/export-meta-info';

<ExportMetaInfo />

Render a `<span />` element with the current year, works well with React Server Components, React Server-side Rendering, no "mismatch" errors.

## Usage

During the server-side rendering, the `defaultYear` prop is required and its value will be emitted to the output HTML. On the client-side, the `defaultYear` prop will be used for hydration. After hydration is done, the `<CurrentYear />` component will re-render with the `new Date().getFullYear()`.

```tsx filename="src/footer.tsx" copy
export default function Footer() {
  return (
    <footer>
      <p>
        &copy; 2018 - <CurrentYear defaultYear={2023} /> All rights reserved.
      </p>
    </footer>
  )
}
```
