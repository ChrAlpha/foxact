While you might be using `onClick` all the time in your React components, the `click` event will fire at a delay of about 100ms to 300ms (check yours at [InstantClick's Click test](http://instantclick.io/click-test)) after the `mousedown` event on non-touch devices. InstantClick and Next.js's `<Link />` component benefit from this behavior by prefetching the page on the `mousedown` (or `mousenter`) event and then performing navigation on the `click` event, making the navigation feels instant. Yet, we can make the app feel smoother by removing this delay on non-navigation user interactions (like clicking a button to show a dialog or menu). Here is where `useFastClick` comes in.

## Usage

```tsx copy
import { useFastClick } from 'foxact/use-fast-click';

<button
  {...useFastClick(useCallback<React.MouseEventHandler<HTMLButtonElement>>(e => {
    // Do something
  }, []))}
/>
```

On non-touch devices, `useFastClick` returns `{ onMouseDown }`. The event handler will be invoked on the `mousedown` event so there will be no delay.

On touch devices (detected with `(pointer: coarse)` media query), `useFastClick` returns `{ onClick }`, because `mousedown` event will break scrolling on touch devices.

`useFastClick` should only be used on `<div />` or `<button />` elements. During development, `useFastClick` will validate the element type and warn you if you use it on other elements. The validation is disabled (and will be tree-shaken away) in a production build.
