# useDebouncedState

import ExportMetaInfo from '../components/export-meta-info';

<ExportMetaInfo />

Debounces state changes of **un-controlled components**. This can be useful in case you want to perform a heavy operation based on react state, for example, send a search request.

## Differences with `useDeferredValue`

[`useDeferredValue`](https://react.dev/reference/react/useDeferredValue) is a new React built-in hook introduced in React 18. It has very different usages and goals than `useDebouncedState`:

- `useDeferredValue` can only be used if you have direct access to the original state value, while `useDebouncedState` is designed to work when you don't have access to the original state value.
- `useDeferredValue` can suppress Suspense fallback from re-appearing when the value changes, which makes it useful in Suspense-based data fetching.
- `useDeferredValue` is better suited to optimizing rendering because it is deeply integrated with React itself and adapts to the user’s device as it doesn’t require choosing any fixed delay. The deferred re-render would happen almost immediately and wouldn’t be noticeable if the user’s device is fast (e.g. powerful laptop), while the re-render could “lag behind” the user interaction proportionally to how slow the device is.
- `useDeferredValue` are interruptible by default, e.g. if React is in the middle of re-rendering a large list, but the user makes another input, React will abandon the current re-render, handle the keystroke, and then start rendering in the background again. While `useDebouncedValue` is not interruptible and wouldn’t improve the "lagging" issue.
- `useDeferredValue` **can not** reduce network requests. Though the re-render triggered by the `useDeferredValue` can be interrupted by user interaction, the returned JSX from the re-render can be discarded by React (due to being outdated during Concurrent Rendering), the re-render itself will always happen and the network request will always be fired.

## Differences with `useDebouncedValue`

[`useDebouncedValue`](/use-debounced-value) is another hook provided by **foxact**. However, it is designed to work with controlled components:

- `useDebouncedState` is used for un-controlled components (The `defaultValue` prop and the `onChange` prop, no `value` prop)
- With `useDebouncedState` you can not have direct access to the original state value.

## Usage

Below is an example of different use cases of `useDebouncedState` and `useDeferredValue`, and how they can be used together:

```tsx copy
import { useDeferredValue } from 'react';
import useSWR from 'swr';
import { useDebouncedState } from 'foxact/use-debounced-state';

const Example = () => {
  const [debouncedValue, debouncilySetState] = useDebouncedState(
    // The initial value or a pure function that will return the initial value, just like the useState
    initialValue,
    // delay in ms
    300,
    // optional, default to false. whether to immediately update the debounced value with the first call
    false
  );

  // The debounced value can reduce network requests.
  const { data } = useSWR<string[]>(debouncedValue ? `/api/search?q=${debouncedValue}` : null);

  // useDeferredValue here is used to opt-in the Concurrent Rendering, to improve the UX.
  // The value passed to useDeferredValue must be primitive values or memoized. Here we
  // are relying on useSWR to memoize the returned `data` (which will be an array).
  const deferredData = useDeferredValue(data);

  return (
    <div>
      <input
        // The <input /> here is not controlled by React as we are not using the `value` prop.
        defaultValue={initialValue}
        // Although the `onChange` will be fired on every keystroke, the state update will be
        // debounced
        onChange={useCallback((e) => debouncilySetState(e.target.value), [debouncilySetState])}
      />
      {/**
        * <FancyYetSlowSearchResult /> needs to be wrapped in React.memo, so that it will
        * only re-render when the `deferredData` changes, not when the `debouncedValue` changes.
        */}
      <FancyYetSlowSearchResult
        // The re-render of <FancyYetSlowSearchResult /> will be interruptible, as it will
        // be triggered by `useDeferredValue`.
        // So <FancyYetSlowSearchResult /> may be slow to render, the entire UI will always
        // remain responsive.
        list={deferredData}
      />
    </div>
  );
}
```
