# useDebouncedValue

import ExportMetaInfo from '../components/export-meta-info';

<ExportMetaInfo />

Debounces state changes of **controlled components**. This can be useful in case you want to perform a heavy operation based on react state, for example, send a search request.

## Differences with `useDeferredValue`

[`useDeferredValue`](https://react.dev/reference/react/useDeferredValue) is a new React built-in hook introduced in React 18. It is similar to `useDebouncedValue` but has a few differences:

- `useDeferredValue` can suppress Suspense fallback from re-appearing when the value changes, which makes it useful in Suspense-based data fetching.
- `useDeferredValue` is better suited to optimizing rendering because it is deeply integrated with React itself and adapts to the user’s device as it doesn’t require choosing any fixed delay. The deferred re-render would happen almost immediately and wouldn’t be noticeable if the user’s device is fast (e.g. powerful laptop), while the re-render could “lag behind” the user interaction proportionally to how slow the device is.
- `useDeferredValue` are interruptible by default, e.g. if React is in the middle of re-rendering a large list, but the user makes another input, React will abandon the current re-render, handle the keystroke, and then start rendering in the background again. While `useDebouncedValue` is not interruptible and wouldn’t improve the "lagging" issue.
- `useDeferredValue` **can not** reduce network requests. Though the re-render triggered by the `useDeferredValue` can be interrupted by user interaction, the returned JSX from the re-render can be discarded by React (due to being outdated during Concurrent Rendering), the re-render itself will always happen and the network request will always be fired.

## Differences with `useDebouncedState`

[`useDebouncedState`](/use-debounced-state) is another hook provided by **foxact**. However, it is designed to work with un-controlled components:

- `useDebouncedValue` is used for controlled components (e.g. both `value` and `onChange` prop).
- `useDebouncedValue` can only be used if you have direct access to the original state value.

## Usage

Below is an example of different use cases of `useDebouncedValue` and `useDeferredValue`, and how they can be used together:

```tsx copy
import { useState, useDeferredValue } from 'react';
import useSWR from 'swr';
import { useDebouncedValue } from 'foxact/use-debounced-value';

const Example = () => {
  const [value, setValue] = useState('');
  const debouncedValue = useDebouncedValue(
    value,
    // delay in ms
    300,
    // optional, default to false. whether to immediately update the debounced value with the first call
    false
  );

  // useDebouncedValue here is used to reduce network requests.
  const { data } = useSWR<string[]>(debouncedValue ? `/api/search?q=${debouncedValue}` : null);

  // useDeferredValue here is used to opt-in the Concurrent Rendering, to improve the UX.
  // The value passed to useDeferredValue must be primitive values or memoized. Here we
  // are relying on useSWR to memoize the returned `data` (which will be an array).
  const deferredData = useDeferredValue(data);

  return (
    <div>
      {/**
        * The value we passed to <input /> can never be debounced nor deferred, so the UI
        * will always represent the user input immediately.
        */}
      <input value={value} onChange={useCallback((e) => setValue(e.target.value), [])} />
      {/**
        * <FancyYetSlowSearchResult /> needs to be wrapped in React.memo, so that it will
        * only re-render when the `deferredData` changes, not when the `value` nor
        * `debouncedValue` changes.
        */}
      <FancyYetSlowSearchResult
        // The re-render of <FancyYetSlowSearchResult /> will be interruptible, as it will
        // be triggered by `useDeferredValue`.
        // So <FancyYetSlowSearchResult /> may be slow to render, the entire UI will always
        // remain responsive.
        list={deferredData}
      />
    </div>
  );
}
```
