# useReactRouterIsMatch (React Router v6)

import ExportMetaInfo from '../components/export-meta-info';

<ExportMetaInfo />

Programmatically returns whether the current location matches the given path. Useful when building a navigation menu, such as a breadcrumb or a set of tabs where you'd like to show which of them is currently selected. This is designed to be an alternative of React Router DOM v6's `<NavLink />` component's render prop approach.

## Usage

```tsx
import { clsx } from 'clsx';
import * as styles from './navbar.module.css';
import { Link } from 'react-router-dom';
import { useReactRouterIsMatch } from 'foxact/use-react-router-is-match';

interface NavLinkProps {
  to: string
}

const NavLink = ({ to }: NavLinkProps) => {
  const isActive = useReactRouterIsMatch(to);

  return (
    <Link to={to} className={clsx(styles.link, isActive && styles.active)}>
      {isActive ? 'You are already here!' : 'Click Me!'}
    </Link>
  )
}
```
